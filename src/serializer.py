This module implements the case toolkit serialization methods
for serializing ontologies and json-ld data files.

Each serialized file is a binary file that contains three sections:
        The 8-byte identifier ("magic number"): "ontology" or "casedata"
        The python-pickled metadata dictionary
        The python-pickled Ontology or CaseData object

The python-pickled dictionary includes:
        source:      The path to the item that was serialized
        md5:         The md5 of the item that was serialized
        timestamp:   The creation date and time
        description: A user-supplied description

The reason for the metadata is because if there are multiple
serialized file for different versions of data, we can be sure
which one contains which data.

This file structure allows examination of the metadata without
having to read the entire object.
